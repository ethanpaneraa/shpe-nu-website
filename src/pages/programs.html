                    <p>Northwestern SHPE's Freshmen Round program provides Northwestern first-years an opportunity to engage and work 
                        closely with our organization and executive board. Participants learn more about different aspects of our 
                        chapter that run SHPE NU and receive mentorship on navigating Northwestern and maximizing their first-year 
                        experience by providing participants an opportunity to engage and plan out events for our chapter and its community. 
                        Participants of FRT are encouraged to run for an official executive board position for the following school year.

                    <p>Our mentorship program provides one-on-one mentorship for first-generation and low-income Latine identifying 
                        STEM/Engineering students at Northwestern. Mentees are matched with high-quality and committed mentors who are 
                        meant to support and encourage mentees in their journey at Northwestern and to provide the necessary guidance and 
                        support needed to succeed at Northwestern. This program runs quarterly and is encouraged that mentors/mentees continue 
                        to build upon their relationship after the quarter ends. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>High School Initiative Program (HSIP) is SHPEâ€™s Community Outreach recreation of Noche de Ciencas where we host 
                        different high schools from around the Evanston and Chicago area. This past Fall Quarter 2022, we revived the HSIP 
                        event after 6 years. Previous HSIP events had been hosted by NU SHPE in the spring. However, our team determined that 
                        hosting our events in the fall would be most useful to students applying to colleges in the following months especially 
                        if they are considering a career in STEM. Our event provided the following info:</p>
