                community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support,

            <p class="about-us-paragraph">In the mid-1990s, SHPE Northwestern was founded as a source of encouragement for the 
                underrepresented Latinx minorities in Engineering at Northwestern. As of this year, we have grown to over 110 active members. 
                We are currently in the process of further expanding our reach at Northwestern and maintaining our local chapter's history, as well as furthering our connection with out alumni</p>
